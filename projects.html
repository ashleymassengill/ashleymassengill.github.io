      <h4>what I'm working on right now</h4>
      <p>Currently, I am working on developing the user interface for a mobile app called diaBEATthis, geared towards assisting diabetes sufferers with tracking their glucose levels and insulin intake with the goal of getting the disease under control.</p>
      <p>The initial phase of this project will be the creation of a website and web app that allows users to create an account, and log their blood test results at set times through the day, along with what insulin they are taking at the same times. The app will also connect to other health tracking apps to import fitness activity and diet. The user will also be able to set reminders for testing and insulin.</p>
